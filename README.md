# Automatic Bass Drum Pedal

## Abstract

This paper aims to design and implement an Automatic Bass Drum Pedal with the help of an embedded board which will aid musicians to keep time and rhythm in accordance with a preset time signature, an input pattern taken from the user at the time, or a pattern from a given sound track. An Automatic Bass Drum Pedal, as the name suggests, consists of a bass drum and its pedal which is mode controlled not only to aid musicians during practice, recordings, and live performances but also provides specific advantages to drummers. An Automated Bass Drum Pedal, with the help of an embedded board, will aid musicians to keep time and rhythm in various modes of operation.

## 1 Introduction

Being a form of art and cultural activity, Music can be defined as a sound placed in time. This project focuses on rhythm and the role of the drum in creating a full musical experience. The Automatic Bass Drum Pedal is designed to aid disabled musicians and provide a more natural feeling of rhythm compared to digital tracks.

## 2 Literature Review and Motivation

This section reviews relevant literature that influenced the project's design. The motivation behind the project includes addressing the limitations of electronic music and providing opportunities for physically challenged musicians.

## 3 Hardware Design

Details the hardware components used in the project, including the Raspberry Pi Model B, solenoid motor, and LCD display. Schematics and physical models are provided.

## 4 Software Used

Describes the software tools utilized in the project, including Processing, MATLAB, and Proteus Design Suite.

## 5 Modes of Working

Explains the different modes of operation for the Automatic Bass Drum Pedal, including Mode 1, Mode 2, Mode 3, and Mode 4. Each mode is designed to offer various ways of achieving rhythm synchronization.

## 6 Working of Mode 4

Describes the song recognition process implemented in Mode 4 using both software and hardware approaches. Spectrogram analysis and energy algorithms are used for song recognition.

## 7 Results and Observations

Presents the results and observations of the project, including song recognition accuracy and beat detection algorithm performance.

## 8 Challenges Faced and Our Approach

Discusses the challenges encountered during the project, such as lack of access to hardware components, and the strategies adopted to overcome these challenges.
